                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I'm a first year Informatics Major starting a minor in Computer Science, and I
                        plan to graduate
                        in 2023. Programming is one of my greatest passions, as well as video games, movies, cooking and
                        hanging out with my friends and family. My main goal is to enter the field of game development,
                        but specifically the area of software development/design. I want to pursue Informatics because
                        it is out of the ordinary. I could have easily gone into Computer Science at a number of
                        different schools, but I wanted to stand out in the field of endless applicants for the current
                        job market. Informatics seems like it delves into the modern day struggle of technology and its
                        manifestation, and I want to help push the field forward. My role in helping create the website
                        includes designing the original layout, programming the data visualization, and theory-crafting
                        the current design with Nathan.

                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I am an informatics major, sophomore, with a passion for technology. In my free
                        time I
                        enjoy playing
                        video games, watching movies, and spending time with my family and girlfriend. My biggest hobby
                        is
                        creating content for people all around the world on YouTube on my channel titled “ItsApollo” and
                        my
                        second channel “Team-PokeColorsV2”, something I've done since 2011 and continue to do weekly. I
                        take
                        pride in the content I make and hope to one day make a living from being a content creator, as a
                        hobby
                        as I am still unsure of what career best suits my personal goals and aspirations through life.
                        I’m a
                        big
                        Star Wars and Pokemon fan and you can often find me relaxing with a nice cup of hot coffee. My
                        role
                        in
                        the construction of this website includes writing for the Data Description page and I also
                        helped
                        with
                        the programming aspect of the Data Visualization page.</p>

                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I’m an Informatics Major at IUPUI graduating in 2023. I like to play music and
                        play video games.
                        I currently play in a band called Maccogallo, and we recently released a full length, 13 track
                        album called “Hounds.” I hope to work making websites and or programs for musicians to use when
                        recording or making music in general. I really love making people laugh even though I don’t
                        think I’m funny at all. I am an Informatics major because I am very interested in computers and
                        creating anything I can on computers. I want to learn how they work and what I can do in order
                        to make doing certain things easier or more fun for other users. I plan to specialize in
                        learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I am open to learning multiple languages so I can
                        specialize in any area that I may be needed or required.</p>

                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I'm a freshman at IUPUI this year. I'm an exploratory major with a passion for
                        coding and drawing
                        and illustration. Before Intro to Informatics, my only experience with coding was in
                        spreadsheets and ROBOT-C from a Principles of Engineering course in high school. Thanks to this
                        class, I've broadened my expertise, being able to learn new code as well as help design the
                        visual bulk of the website. Moving forward, I will actually be pursuing a major in Drawing and
                        Illustration at Herron School of Art, but I have no doubt that the knowledge I've learned in
                        this class will benefit me as an artist when I find myself in need of building a professional
                        website to host an artist portfolio. Or perhaps using the website IN the portfolio, haha. Even
                        as an artist I will have a passion for thinking logically through the use of code.</p>

                    <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;James is an exploratory student at IUPUI. This class was not his first endeavor
                        into programming,
                        and surely not his last as he continues to explore his passions. He loves his dog and playing
                        videogames in his free time. James sadly has been busy this semester but helped out where he
                        could. He's considering taking a break from college to explore some different opportunities, and
                        we
                        wish him the best of luck from the INFO-101 class!</p>
